# Mid Project
## 1. Resume
This project intention was to analyse the premier league games in a considerable timeframe, with some football stats and also weather stats.
The goal was to create a model with those stats to check its predictions accuracy, and check the influence of weather conditions in football performance.
As each time is unique, in the end the analysis is done for each time.

## 2. Datasets
Two main datasets were used for this model:

  1. Football results data from kaggle:

  2. Weather data from: https://www.visualcrossing.com/weather/weather-data-services#

The data considered is dated from 2017-08-11 until 2022-11-14.

## 3. Data cleaning and modelling
